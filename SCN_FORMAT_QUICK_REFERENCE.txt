================================================================================

KEY FINDING: The two games use COMPLETELY INCOMPATIBLE scenario file formats.
They have different magic numbers, header structures, and data layouts.
These are almost certainly different game engines or very different versions.

SIMILARITY: Both games store similar content (missions, units, locations) but
in completely different binary formats.

FILE LOCATIONS:
  - All V is for Victory .SCN files: /home/user/atomic_ed/game/v_is_for_victory/game/
  - All D-Day .SCN files: /home/user/atomic_ed/game/dday/game/SCENARIO/

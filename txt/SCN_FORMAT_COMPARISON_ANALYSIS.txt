SCENARIO FILE (.SCN) FORMAT COMPARISON ANALYSIS
V is for Victory vs D-Day
================================================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
=================
The .SCN (scenario) file formats are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT between the two games.
They use distinct magic numbers, header structures, and data layouts. The formats
are NOT compatible and appear to be from entirely different game engines.

PART 2: MAGIC NUMBERS AND FILE HEADERS
================================================================================

V IS FOR VICTORY FORMAT
  Magic Number: 0x0C0C (3084 in decimal)
  Header: Consistent across ALL 27 files
  First 4 bytes: 0c 0c 00 00
  
  Format: Little-endian, starting at offset 0x00
  - Bytes 0-3:   0x0C0C (magic number)
  - Bytes 4-7:   Version/Type identifier (varies: 00 03 02, 00 02 06, 00 01 06)
  - Bytes 8-11:  0x66660640 (constant marker?)
  - Bytes 12+:   Mixed binary data with embedded text strings

D-DAY FORMAT
  Magic Number: 0x1230 (4656 in decimal)
  Header: Consistent across ALL 7 files
  First 4 bytes: 30 12 00 00
  
  Format: Little-endian 32-bit integers starting at offset 0x04
  - Bytes 0-3:   0x1230 (magic number)
  - Bytes 4-7:   0x11 00 00 00 (17 decimal - possibly count of something)
  - Bytes 8-11:  0x05 00 00 00 (5 decimal)
  - Bytes 12-15: 0x0A 00 00 00 (10 decimal)
  - ... continues with more 32-bit integers (appears to be counts or array sizes)

CONCLUSION: Completely different file formats with different magic numbers.

================================================================================
PART 3: DETAILED HEADER ANALYSIS (First 64 bytes)
================================================================================

V IS FOR VICTORY (GJSBEACH.SCN as example):
Offset  Hex                                    ASCII
0x00    0c 0c 00 00 00 03 02 00 66 66 06 40  ........ff.@....
0x10    00 00 2c 00 32 00 00 00 00 00 01 01  ..,.2...........
0x20    59 7c 01 00 6f 7c 01 00 08 06 02 00  Y|..o|..........
0x30    01 01 00 00 58 00 0c 00 16 00 00 00  ....X...........

Observations:
  - Bytes 0x18-0x1F appear to contain little-endian offsets (0x017c59, 0x017c6f)
  - Bytes are mostly non-zero with structured pattern
  - Text data embedded starting around offset 0x80

D-DAY (BRADLEY.SCN as example):
Offset  Hex                                    ASCII
0x00    30 12 00 00 11 00 00 00 05 00 00 00  0...............
0x10    0a 00 00 00 08 00 00 00 05 00 00 00  ................
0x20    08 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0a 00 00 00  ................
0x30    14 00 00 00 05 00 00 00 7d 00 00 00  ............}...

Observations:
  - Bytes 0x04-0x34 contain series of little-endian 32-bit integers
  - Values appear to be counts: 17, 5, 10, 8, 5, 8, 10, 20, 5, 125, 100
  - Large sparse block of zeros follows (data starts much later)
  - Offsets at 0x40-0x50: 0x017c77, 0x017c81, 0x0748, 0x10a4

CONCLUSION: Fundamentally different header structures and data organization.

================================================================================
PART 4: BINARY STRUCTURE PATTERNS
================================================================================

V IS FOR VICTORY STRUCTURE
  - Compact, mixed binary and text data
  - Text strings appear early (around offset 0x80+)
  - Binary records interspersed throughout
  - Contains mission briefing text early in file
  - Pointer/offset values embedded at offset 0x18+
  - File padding: mostly zeros at end
  - Example text found:
    "You have managed to make it ashore with minimal losses..."
    "The Commonwealth has landed several divisions in your area..."
    Location names: Bayeux, Tilly-sur-Seulles, Villers-Bocage, Caen
    Unit designations: I Corps, XXX Corps, etc.

D-DAY STRUCTURE
  - Header of 32-bit integers (probably table of contents)
  - Large sparse region with many zeros (0x00-0x200+)
  - Data appears to start at offset 0x220+
  - Contains structured numerical data records
  - Text appears later in file (around 0x220+)
  - Repeating patterns of structured binary records
  - Example text found:
    "Your mission is to advance on the town of Caumont..."
    Location names: Caumont, Balleroy, the Drome
    Unit designations: 102-V, 745-V, 1st Infantry

CONCLUSION: Different internal organization - V4V is more compact and integrated,
           D-Day has a header with counts followed by structured data.

================================================================================
PART 5: FILE CONTENT COMPARISON
================================================================================

SIMILAR CONTENT ELEMENTS (mission briefing, locations, units):
  - Both contain mission briefing text
  - Both list location/town names
  - Both list military unit designations
  - Both store game scenario data (map, units, objectives)

DIFFERENT ENCODING:
  - V4V: Appears to mix binary records with text more closely
  - D-Day: Clear separation of header counts from data section
  - Different pointer/offset systems
  - Different record formats for units and map data

EXAMPLE CONTENT:
  V4V briefing: "You have managed to make it ashore..."
  D-Day briefing: "Your mission is to advance on the town..."
  
  Both contain military unit information and location data, but in
  completely different binary formats.

================================================================================
PART 6: SIZE ANALYSIS AND PATTERNS
================================================================================

V IS FOR VICTORY
  Smallest: MGHELL.SCN (35,108 bytes)
  Largest: VLCAMP.SCN (134,440 bytes)
  Range: 35KB - 134KB
  Average: 81.4KB
  
  Note: Files of similar complexity vary significantly in size,
        suggesting variable-length data structures or different
        compression/optimization strategies

D-DAY
  Smallest: COUNTER.SCN (31,382 bytes)
  Largest: CAMPAIGN.SCN (276,396 bytes)
  Range: 31KB - 276KB
  Average: 121.8KB
  
  Note: Campaign file is much larger (2x average), possibly due to
        larger map or more units

================================================================================
PART 7: POINTER AND OFFSET ANALYSIS
================================================================================

V IS FOR VICTORY (GJSBEACH.SCN)
  At offset 0x18-0x20:
    0x017C59 (decimal 97369)
    0x017C6F (decimal 97391)
  These appear to point to data structures within the file.

D-DAY (BRADLEY.SCN)
  At offset 0x40-0x50:
    0x017C77 (decimal 97399)
    0x017C81 (decimal 97409)
    0x000748 (decimal 1864)
    0x0010A4 (decimal 4260)
  These also appear to be internal offsets.

NOTE: While both use 32-bit little-endian offsets, they point to
      different file structures and are positioned differently in
      the header.

================================================================================
PART 8: CONCLUSION
================================================================================

ANSWER: Are the .SCN file formats similar or identical?
        COMPLETELY DIFFERENT - NOT COMPATIBLE

KEY FINDINGS:

1. DIFFERENT MAGIC NUMBERS
   - V4V: 0x0C0C
   - D-Day: 0x1230
   These are unmistakable markers that the formats are incompatible.

2. DIFFERENT HEADER STRUCTURES
   - V4V: Version/type info + mixed binary-text layout
   - D-Day: Series of 32-bit count/size integers

3. DIFFERENT DATA ORGANIZATION
   - V4V: Compact with early text integration
   - D-Day: Header counts followed by sparse data section

4. DIFFERENT POINTER SYSTEMS
   - Both use 32-bit offsets but at different positions
   - Different offset values for same-sized files

5. DIFFERENT FILE SIZES
   - V4V average: 81.4 KB
   - D-Day average: 121.8 KB
   - Not proportional, suggesting different data compression or structures

6. SAME CONTENT TYPE
   - Both store military scenario information
   - Both have mission briefing, locations, units
   - But encoding is completely different

IMPLICATIONS:

- These games use different game engines or versions of an engine
- Scenario files are NOT interchangeable between games
- Would require separate parsers/converters to translate between formats
- The games likely have different map representations, unit systems, etc.
- Reverse engineering would require analyzing each format independently

RECOMMENDATION:

If converting scenarios between games is desired:
1. Parse V4V files according to V4V format specification
2. Extract mission data, map info, units, objectives
3. Translate to D-Day format specification
4. Re-encode in D-Day binary format
5. Extensive testing required due to potential game engine differences

The formats are definitely incompatible at the binary level.
